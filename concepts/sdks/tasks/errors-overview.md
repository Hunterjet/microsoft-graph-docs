# Errors in the Microsoft Graph client libraries

Microsoft Graph returns may different types of errors.

## Working with errors

# [C#](#tab/CS)

Anytime you make a request against the service there is the potential for an error. In the case of an error, the request will throw a [ServiceException](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet-core/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.Graph.Core/Exceptions/ServiceException.cs) object with an inner `Error` object that contains the service error details.

## Checking the error

There are a few different types of errors that can occur during a network call. These error codes are defined in [GraphErrorCode.cs](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.Graph/Enums/GraphErrorCode.cs).

### Checking the error code
You can easily check if an error has a specific code by calling `IsMatch` on the error code value. `IsMatch` is not case sensitive:

```csharp
if (exception.IsMatch(GraphErrorCode.AccessDenied.ToString())
{
        // Handle access denied error
}
```

Each error object has a `Message` property as well as code. This message is for debugging purposes and is not be meant to be displayed to the user. Common error codes are defined in [GraphErrorCode.cs](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.Graph/Enums/GraphErrorCode.cs).
